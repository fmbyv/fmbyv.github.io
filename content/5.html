<h1> Scrum Anti-patterns </h1><br />
    As agile practices become increasingly popular within organizations, it is important to understand the differences between Scrum and Kanban. Scrum is a framework used to manage software development and other processes. It is based on a set of principles that provide a structure for teams to work in an iterative and incremental manner. Scrum is typically used to deliver a product in a short time-frame, and is based on the idea of continuous improvement.<br />
<br />
Kanban is a visual approach to managing work. It is based on the idea of limiting work in progress and providing visibility into the progress of tasks. Kanban is typically used to manage ongoing workflows, such as maintenance and support. It is not typically used to deliver a product in a short time-frame, but instead focuses on the efficient completion of tasks over a longer period of time.<br />
<br />
When deciding which approach to use, it is important to consider the goals of the team and the specific context in which the work is being done. Scrum can provide structure and guidance to teams that need to deliver a product in a short time-frame. Kanban can provide visibility into the progress of tasks and help teams manage ongoing workflows. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, the choice between Scrum and Kanban comes down to the specific needs of the team and the situation at hand. It is important to understand the differences between the two approaches and to select the right one for the job.</body>
